        <h1>ðŸ‘‹ Storyboard, Character, Set, and Mechanical Design</h1>
        <p>
            My group and I split the work for the most part in half, where I did the coding half and she did the set and character designs but there were some portions I was responsible for. For our storyboard I was responsible for the design and creation of our main character Anne.  Anne was designed out of clay and has brownish clay as a skin color to represent her as a minority, specifically someone of hispanic/latina descent We wanted to make her a part of a marginalized group to showcase how hard it is for minorities to receive proper health care, even without laws. She is fashioned wearing a pink shirt and pants. Originally, when I created Anne, I made her stomach flatter to represent that she was earlier along in her pregnancy, considering that's when abortions are usually done, but my partner, Fiona suggested that I make it bigger so that itâ€™s clear to the audience that she is pregnant and seeking an abortion. In terms of the story portion, we came up with it together, but I cam up with the idea of Anne seeing the Roe v. Wade overturned the sign, so that it is clear to the audience what kind of procedure Anne is looking to obtain. In the video of our animated storyboard, you can see that when Anne visits the undercover doctor a red light is shown. I suggested adding this in because red typically represents something bad or death, which is exactly what happens to Anne when she sees the secondary doctor. I knew that the death of Anne was clear to me and my group but I wanted to make sure it was clear to our audience.

            The technology and code is what I specialized in for our project. We did a motorized story box and we used makecode.adafruit.com. I originally wrote code that would utilize motors, ut after talking to Mr. Sinusas, I realized that servos would be better for making more deliberate rotations for our characters, considering they had to all be at specific places at a certain time. I had a few struggles with the code up until the day the project was due. It was a little hard to figure out which direction was which with the servos, so it involved a lot of trial and error. We soon came to find that their servos only really rotated 45 degrees. This meant we had to make a few last adjustments to the set but we worked it out, because I learned that I could set the servos at different starting points which would give the illusion that it is tuning a further distance.. The picture I included was the final code for Anne, the nurse, and the undercover doctor. I had to often revise the amount of time in between the rotations so that I didnâ€™t go too fast, but after a few times I found a good balance.

        <p>
            We worked with our characters, storyboard, and set to create a story that shows a dramatized worst case scenario of when a woman is denied an abortion. We over exaggerated Annes pregnancy and added dramatic lighting to make a mre scary/sad mood when Anne died. We created a story that ended in death, which isnâ€™t always how unsafe  abortions end, but we wanted our audience to walk away from this feeling of despair, about how could this happen to someone? So that they realize that this does happen to people, and that this hopefully feeling motivated to help advocate for women's reproductive and abortion rights.
