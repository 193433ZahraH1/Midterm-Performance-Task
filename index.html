        <h1>ðŸ‘‹ Storyboard, Character, Set, and Mechanical Design</h1>
        <p>
            My group and I split the work for the most part in half, where I did the coding half and she did the set and character designs but there were some portions I was responsible for. For our storyboard I was responsible for the design and creation of our main character Anne.  Anne was designed out of clay and has brownish clay as a skin color to represent her as a minority, specifically someone of hispanic/latina descent We wanted to make her a part of a marginalized group to showcase how hard it is for minorities to receive proper health care, even without laws. She is fashioned wearing a pink shirt and pants. Originally, when I created Anne, I made her stomach flatter to represent that she was earlier along in her pregnancy, considering that's when abortions are usually done, but my partner, Fiona suggested that I make it bigger so that itâ€™s clear to the audience that she is pregnant and seeking an abortion. In terms of the story portion, we came up with it together, but I cam up with the idea of Anne seeing the Roe v. Wade overturned the sign, so that it is clear to the audience what kind of procedure Anne is looking to obtain. In the video of our animated storyboard, you can see that when Anne visits the undercover doctor a red light is shown. I suggested adding this in because red typically represents something bad or death, which is exactly what happens to Anne when she sees the secondary doctor. I knew that the death of Anne was clear to me and my group but I wanted to make sure it was clear to our audience.
